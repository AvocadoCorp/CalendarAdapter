CalendarAdapter
==========

This library provides a set of views to display a calendar with symbols representing events and an adapter to
manage them in a ListView.

It uses the builder pattern to construct the adapter with several (optional) customizable parameters.

## Overview

Add a `ListView` to your XML layout file:

```xml
<ListView
    android:id="@+id/calendar_list_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

Grab a reference to it:

```java
ListView calendarListView = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.calendar_list_view);
```

Construct a `CalendarAdapter` with `CalendarAdapter.Builder`:

```java
CalendarAdapter adapter = new CalendarAdapter.Builder(this)
        .startDate(new Date())
        .eventDates(eventDates)
        .onDateSelectedListener(this)
        .create();
```

Then hand off the `CalendarAdapter` to your `ListView` and you're good to go:

```java
calendarListView.setAdapter(adapter);
```

`CalendarAdapter` also contains the following public methods for manipulating its data after initialization:

##### addEventDate(Date date)

Add an event represented by its date.

##### setEventDates(List\<Date\> eventDates)

Set all the events to be displayed.  All previous data will be cleared.  You may use this to set events after `CalendarAdapter`  initialization, but if all the events are known prior to initialization you should pass the eventDates in the corresponding `CalendarAdapter.Builder` method.

## Customization

There are several additional parameters you can pass to the `CalendarAdapter.Builder`.

##### startDate(Date startDate)

Any date in the first month to be displayed.

##### endDate(Date endDate)

Any date in the last month to be displayed.

##### titleTypeface(Typeface titleTypeface)

The typeface for the name of the month (i.e. January, February).

##### daysOfWeekTypeface(Typeface daysOfWeekTypeface)

The typeface for the days of the week (i.e. Sun, Mon, Tue).

##### calendarCellTypeface(Typeface calendarCellTypeface)

The typeface for the numbers in the calendar cells.

##### titleTextColor(int titleTextColor)

The text color for the name of the month (i.e. January, February).

##### daysOfWeekTextColor(int daysOfWeekTextColor)

The text color for the days of the week (i.e. Sun, Mon, Tue).

##### calendarCellTextColor(int calendarCellTextColor)

The text color for the numbers in the calendar cells.

##### eventColor(int eventColor)

The color of the squares to symbolize events in the calendar cells.

##### pastFutureCalendarCellBackgroundColor(int pastFutureCalendarCellBackgroundColor)

The color for the background of the calendar cells outside of the current displayed month.

##### pastFutureCalendarCellTextColor(int pastFutureCalendarCellTextColor)

The text color for the calendar cells outside of the current displayed month.

##### pastFutureEventColor(int pastFutureEventColor)

The color of the squares to symbolize events in calendar cells outside of the current displayed month.

##### calendarCellBorderColor(int calendarCellBorderColor)

The border color for the 1-pixel wide calendar cell borders.

##### onDateSelectedListener(OnDateSelectedListener listener)

A listener that implements the method:

```java
public void onDateSelected(Date date)
```

##### eventDates(List\<Date\> eventDates)

A `List` of Java `Date` objects representing an event.  These are shown as colored squares on the calendar.
